Here are some commands you can use it to control the onboard LED of arduino.
"blink" -  type voice command makes onboard led of arduino to blink in every one second
"on" - type voice command it will turn on the LED
"off" - type voice command it will turn off the LED
First run "pip install -r requirements.txt" it will install all the libraries needed for this project to run
then upload "control.ino" file to your arduino device
then open any IDE or windows cmd and open the main.py file and just run it if you are on IDE you can just run it from inside but if you want to run it 
on CMD then use command "python main.py"
if it returns error like python not found then go add the path of python in the environment variable.
***NOTE - This method also works on nodemcu but it will be only serial transfer just like arduino. ðŸ’¯
 main
